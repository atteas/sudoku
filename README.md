<p align="center">This sudoku was made for a upper secondary high school course. In this project I wanted to also create a bit customizability and a profile for the player in addition for the sudoku. I also wanted to implement a system to traverse the cells in the sudoku easier, and ended up doing it by using arrow keys for it. With this project I learned more about local storage and handling files to save and load data, slightly since I didn't want to take this project as far as setting up a server for profile saving data etc... . The data is currently in JSON-format, so editing it isn't hard, which does leave the opportunity for a player to cheat, but since this isn't a competition I think it doesn't matter.</p>
